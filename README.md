![unnamed1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb888c6c-bc4c-4a09-ace1-b0fca9a09f94)


Copy the three commands one by one into a PowerShell (Administrator) console. (You must edit the first command and replace "your key here" with the key corresponding to your version of Windows.) 


e.g.  for Windows 10 Pro  =>  ``` slmgr /ipk  VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T```


Note: The keys you need to copy are the ones in the "KMS Client Setup Key" box.
